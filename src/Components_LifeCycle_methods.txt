What are component life cycle phases?
1.mounting phase
2.Updating Phase 
3.Unmounting Phase

1.Mounting Phase(component creation phase)
This phase occurs when an instace of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
2.Updating Phase (component updates)
This phase occurs when a component is being rerendered as a reslut of changes to either its props or state.
3.Unmounting Phase(Removal from the DOM)
This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.

What are component Life Cycle methods?
component lifecycle methods aee special methods that get called at various stages of a component's life
Mounting Phase:
constructor() //
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidmount()

Updating Phase:
getDerivedStateFromProps()
ShouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getsnapshotBeforeUpdate()
ComponentDidUpdate()

Unmounting Phase()
componentwillUnmount()

 constructor() - This is the first method that gets called when a component is created
 constructor is a special method that is called when instace of the class is created.
 it is used for intializing the component or performing any setup that is needed before the component is used
 constructor is called with props as an argument
 Super keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class

 getDerivedStateFromProps() - This is the second method that gets called when a component is created
getDerivedStateFromProps is a static method that is called when the component is created and whenever the props of the component change

render() - This is the third method that gets called when a component is created
 render is a method that returns the JSX that should be rendered by the component
 render is a pure method that does not modify the component state or props

// componentDidMount() - This is the fourth method that gets called when a component is created
// componentDidMount is called after the component is rendered for the first time
// componentDidMount is used for performing any side effects that require the component to be rendered
// componentDidMount is called only once in the component lifecycle

// getDerivedStateFromProps() - This is the first method that gets called when a component is updated

// getDerivedStateFromProps is a static method that is called when the component is updated and whenever the props of the component change
// getDerivedStateFromProps is used to update the state of the component based on the props

// shouldComponentUpdate() - This is the second method that gets called when a component is updated
// shouldComponentUpdate is called before the component is updated
// shouldComponentUpdate is used to determine if the component should re-render or not
// shouldComponentUpdate is called with the next props and the next state as arguments
// shouldComponentUpdate should return a boolean value

// render() - This is the third method that gets called when a component is updated
// render is a method that returns the JSX that should be rendered by the component
// render is a pure method that does not modify the component state or props

// getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() - This is the fourth method that gets called when a component is updated
// getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is called before the component is updated
// getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is used to capture some information from the DOM before the update
// getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is called with the previous props and the previous state as arguments

// componentDidUpdate() - This is the fifth method that gets called when a component is updated
// componentDidUpdate is called after the component is updated
// componentDidUpdate is used for performing any side effects that require the component to be updated

// Unmounting Phase:
// componentWillUnmount() - This is the method that gets called when a component is unmounted
// componentWillUnmount is called before the component is removed from the DOM
// componentWillUnmount is used for performing any cleanup that is needed before the component is removed


How the state can be Miantained in class component?
Two step process to maintain state:
this,setState()method is used to update the state.
this.state property is used to render the update state in DOM.
