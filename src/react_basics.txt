What is react?
React is a open source javascript Library.
react is used for buliding user interfcaes(UI).
React simplifies the creation od single page application by using resluable components

What are key features of react?
1.vitrual DoM
2.resuable components.
3.component based Architrcture
4.JSx (javascripy XML)
5.Declarative syntax
6.commounity ecosystem 
7.Hooks

1.vitual DOM :
Virtual DOm is an in - memory represenattaion of the real DOM.
What ever presents in real DOM, it is having the same, when ever any changes done in real it takes the only the changes and update in DOM.
it improves the performance of Application.

2.Reusability & Composition:
It react enables the creation of resuable componnets that can be composed together
and can be used anywhere in application.

3.component based:
react structures user interfcae as modular, it will divide into components, it gives the maintaniblity and scalable approce to bulid the app.

4.JSx(javascript XML):
JSX is a syntax textension for the javascript used in the react
allow users to write html like code with javascript, enhacning readability and maintianbility.

5.Declarative syntax:
React have a Declarative programming style(JSX), where developrs focus on the UI should look like
and react handles the how behind the scenes,this simplfy the code.

6.commounity and Ecosystem.
react benifits from a vibrant and extensive community,contributing to arich ecosystem
of libraries,tools and resources.

7.Hooks:
Hooks, are functions that enables the functional components to manage the state mand life cycle methods
which provides a more concise and expressive way to hanlde component logic.

What is DOM? what is diffrence B/w HTML and DOM?
DOm is (Doucment object Model) represents the web page as tree like struture which allows javascript
to dynamically access and manipluate the content and struecture of a web page.

What is Virtual DOM? diff b/w virtual DOm and real DOm?
React uses a virtual DOm to efficent upadte the UI without render the entire page , whcihc helps improve the 
performance and make the application more responsive

diffrence
DoM
1.Dom is actual represenation of webpage.
2.re renders the entire page when upadtes occur
3.can be slower especially with frequent updates.
4. suitable for static websites and simple applications

Vitrual DOM
1.its s lightweight copy of the DOM.
2.when there is any changes then only re renders
3.optimized for faster rerendering
4.ideal for dynamic and complex single page applications with frequesnt updates.

What are react components? what are the main elements of it.
React components are buliding block for creating user interfaces.
everything in react is like components, like header and footer sindenav ecosystem

What is SPA(Single page Application)
A single page Aplication is web application that have only single web page.
whenever user do some action on the webiste, then in response is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading a new page

What are 5 advantages of react?
1.Simple to bulid Single page (by using resuable componnets)
2.React is cross platfrom and open source libraray
3.lightweight and very faster
4.Large community and Ecosystem.
5.test is easy.

What are the disadantages of react?
Its not good for the small applications.

What is role of jsx in react?
1. JSX stands javascript XML
2.jsx is used by react to write HTML like code

What is diffrence b/w Declarative and impertaive?
// Declarative
Declarative syntax focus on describing the desired reslut without specigying the step by step process
JSX in react used to write the declarive syntax

impertaive
Impertaive syntax invoves step by step process to achive a prticular goal
Javascript has an impertaive syntax

What is arrow function expression?
syntax is diffrence it like fat arrow function
the arrow function expression syntax is aconsie way of defining functions

index.html file load , then from there index.js will load that is entry point from there it will call the root
component called the app.jsx from here child components will call.

What is diff b/w react and angular ?
Both are used to create single page UI applications using components.

//react
1.It is javascript libraray.
2.react uses a virtual DOM, which makes a faster
3.Recact is smaller size and lightwright andf therefore faster sometime.
4. react depends on external libraries for many complex features, so dveloper ha to write many lines of code for complex function
5.react is simple to learn and more popular than angular.




//Angular
1. Angualr is a complete framework
2.Angualr uses a real DOM
3.Angualr is bigger beacuse it is complete framework.
4.since angular is complete frame work there fore it provde built in support for features like routing, forms AND HTTP 
4.Angular is slightly difficult to lrean as it has , typescript , opps concept and amny more

What are 5 js framework orther than react?
angualr js
emberjs
angular
vue js
backbone.js

whether react is framework or libraray?
1.developers import the libraries at the topthen use its functions in components.
2.react is commonly referred to as hjavascript.
1.Developers need to follow a spefic sturrcture or pattren defined by the frame work.
2.angular is framework.

How react provide resuablity and Composition?
react provides reusabilty and compostio through its component based architecture.
// resuablity
once you create a componnet, you can re-use it in diffrenets parts
of your application or even in mulitple projects.

//Composition
creating a new big components by combining existing small compnents.its advantage is , chnage to one
small componets will not impact other components.

What are state, stateless,stateful and state management terms?
State refers to the current data of the component.
stateful or state management means, when a user perfoms some actions on the UI
then the react application should be able to updateand render that data or state on the UI
stateless means when you try to update something on UI, after intial State
 not updating or re rednring the state the it is stateless component.

what is role of function and retrun inside the app.js?
function keyword is uses to define a javascript function that represents your react component.
it is like a placeholder which contians all the code or logic of component.
it takes in props as its argument and retruns jsx.
retrun is used to retrun the ements from the function


can we have a function without a retrun inside app.js?
No , to show reslut or to retrun elements we need retrun function.
yes, when you no need to retrun any elements.

export statement is used to make a component avalibale for import using "import" statement in other files

JSX
What is the role of JSX?
Jsx stands for javascript XML

Components -Functional.Class
What are react components? what are main elements of it?
In react a component is aresuable buliding block for creating interfaces
export , import nad function retrun are main elements of react component

What are types of react components? what are functional components?
1.Functional components
functional components are declared as javascript functions
they are stateless component, but with the help of hooks they can now manage state also.
2.class components
class components are defined using javascript classes
they are stateful compoents by using lifecycle methods
render method in a class component is responsible for retruning Jsx

how do you pass data b/w components in functional ?
props are the way to pass data from one component to child componengt

What is prop drilling?
Props drilling is the process of passing dwon the props through multiple layers of compoments.
parent => child => Grand child

Why to avaoid prop drilling?in how many ways props drilling?
Maintenance: prop drilling can make code harder to maintian as chnages in data 
complexity: it increase code complexity
debugging : debugging becomes challenging when props need to be traced through numnerous components

5 ways to avaoud prop drilling:
1.using context API 
2.Using redux
3.uing callbacks
4.Using custom hooks

how to pass data b/w class components
this.props can be used in child component to access properties/data passed from parent component.
<ChildCompoent message={dataToSend} />
in child component
<p>message:{this.props.message} </p>
here this keyword is used to refer to the instance of the class.

diffrence between functional and class componets

1.syntax : defined as a JS function.          1. Defined as JS(ES6)class
2.Originally stateless but can now
maintain state using hooks                    2.can manage local state with this.state
3.lifecycle :No                               3.yes
