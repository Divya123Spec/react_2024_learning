What Is React Fiber, and Why Was It Introduced?

Answer: React Fiber is a reimplementation of React core algorithm for rendering and updating the UI. 
It was introduced to improve the responsiveness of React applications by 
breaking down the rendering work into smaller chunks and allowing interruption and prioritization of tasks. 
This makes React more efficient and capable of handling complex, high-priority updates.

 What Is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React, and Why Is It Beneficial?
 Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React involves rendering the initial HTML on the server 
 and sending it to the client. SSR offers benefits like faster initial page loads, 
 improved SEO(search Engine Optimization), and better perceived performance. 
 Itâ€™s beneficial for applications that require SEO optimization or faster time-to-interactive.


 How Do You Optimize the Performance of a React Application?
Answer: To optimize React application performance, you can:
Use shouldComponentUpdate, PureComponent, or memoization to prevent unnecessary renders.
Profile your app with tools like React DevTools and Chrome DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks.
Implement lazy loading and code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.
Use server-side rendering (SSR) for faster initial rendering.
Employ caching mechanisms for data fetching.
Minimize the use of expensive operations in render methods.


What are synthetic events in React?
Synthetic events combine the response of different browser's native events into one API, 
ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.
The application is consistent regardless of the browser it is running in. Here, preventDefault is a synthetic event.
